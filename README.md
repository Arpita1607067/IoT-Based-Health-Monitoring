# IoT-Based-Health-Monitoring
Design and Development of an IoT-Enabled Health Condition Monitoring Kit.

Now-a-days, health monitoring system plays the
critical role by the observation of health conditions and detecting early vital sings of
disease or ill-condition. In this paper, we proposed a health condition monitoring kit
which is suitable with hardware implementation with the facilities of Internet of
Things(IoT). The method is established on the amalgamation of Raspberry pi and
firebase database. The system monitors body temperature, heartbeat, motion, galvanic
skin response, blood oxygen level, blood pressure of every individual. The system is
designed as user friendly with low cost and potency. Experimental studies shows the
reliance and effectiveness of the proposed system with respect to existing models. In
this way by utilizing this smart health monitoring system diminishes the exertion of
specialists and paramedical staff to screen the patient for 24 hours and furthermore
lessens the time and cost of support.
